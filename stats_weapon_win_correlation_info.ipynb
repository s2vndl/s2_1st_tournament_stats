    "## How is it calculated\n",
    "- each round's kill log is checked\n",
    "- if one player used a weapon for more than 50% of his primary-weapon-kills then tag for that team is created, eg `SteyrAUG_x1`\n",
    "- if there are two players in the team using mainly the same primary weapon in that round, that \"team-round\" will be tagged with `SteyrAUG_x2` instead of two `SteyrAUG_x1`\n",
    "- win or lose tag is added for each \"team-round\"\n",
    "- entries are roughly like this for each round:\n",
    "    - \"game 123123, round 0, team Red, tags: SteyrAug_x2, Deagles_x1, win\"\n",
    "    - \"game 123123, round 0, team Blue, tags: M79_x1, MP5_x1, lose\"\n",
    "- rounds that ended with Tie are ignored altogether\n",
    "- data is filtered to only include balanced games from correct playlist (see \"Parameters\" section)\n",
    "- finally correlation is calculated between win tag and all other tags using [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)"
